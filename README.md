# GeoCoord
Adding a GeoCoord Data Type to PostgreSQL

# Introduction

PostgreSQL has an extensibility model which, among other things, provides a well-defined process for adding new data types into a PostgreSQL server. This capability has led to the development by PostgreSQL users of a number of types (such as polygons) which have become part of the standard distribution. It also means that PostgreSQL is the database of choice in research projects which aim to push the boundaries of what kind of data a DBMS can manage.

In this assignment, we will be adding a new data type for dealing with geographical coordinates. You may implement the functions for the data type in any way you like provided that they satisfy the semantics given below (in the The Geographical Coordinate Data Type section).

**Detailed requirements can be seen in the specifications**
